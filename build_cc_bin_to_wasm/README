this is a project to research how to convert a bazel c++ project to a wasm_cc_binary.

There are two targets:
- hello-world-wasm: very simple c++ binary to test a simple project
- protobuf-wasm: wasm_cc_binary target to wrap protobuf for Proof of Concetp 

How to run hello-world-wasm:
- bazel build hello-world-wasm
- node node bazel-bin/hello-world-wasm/hello-world.js

How to run protobuf-wasm
